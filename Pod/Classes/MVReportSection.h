@class MVReportSectionElement;

/**
 A MVReportSection object draws pages of content in the report, with or without the assistance of section elements. Report section is convinient way to add table-like contnet into the report, where each section can have its own header, footer, and arbitrary number of section elements inbetween.
 
 A report section is an instance of a custom subclass of MVReportSection, and can be added to report as any other MVReportPageElement instance.
 
 The subclass typically overrides one or more of the five `-draw`... methods:
 
 - The `-drawInRect:forPageAtIndex:` by default calls each of the other draw methods, in the order listed below. Your application can override it if you want to have complete control over what is drawn in the section.
 - Override `-drawSectionHeaderForPageAtIndex:inRect:` to draw content in the section header.
 - Override `-drawSectionContentForPageAtIndex:inRect:` to draw the main content of the section in the area between the section header and the section footer.
 - Override `-drawSectionElement:forPageAtIndex:` to intermix custom drawing with the drawing performed by an associated section element. This method is called for each section element associated with a given page.
 - Override `-drawSectionFooterForPageAtIndex:inRect:` to draw content in the section footer.
